     Welcome to The I.T. Guy, a blog about technology, culture, and the insanity 
     of being a developer in San Francisco. 
  
     Deadlines, morning stand-up, tiny $4,000/mo apartments with no a/c, maniacal 
  project managers, poo on the sidewalk -- so, so much poo, fucking MUNI, and bans 
  on drinking straws and vape pens; its all here!
